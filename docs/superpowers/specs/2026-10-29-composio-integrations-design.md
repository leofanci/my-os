# Connected apps via Composio (round 1)

Date: 2026-10-29. Status: design, awaiting approval (user decisions folded in).

## Intent

Let myOS bots work with the user's outside apps (Gmail first) so routine life
and business chores can be handed off, the way Grok Bot, OpenMausBot and Rakazo
do it. Round 1 adds the plumbing and one real job; scheduling and human
teammates come in later rounds but must not be blocked by anything built here.

First real job: **Chief of Staff (`cos`) reads the inbox, summarizes what
matters, and proposes replies. A reply is sent only after the user clicks
Approve.**

Prior art studied (both Apache 2.0, code read): OpenMausBot (`server/composio*.ts`,
`server/connector-proxy.ts`, `shared/outbound.ts`, `server/outbound-hold.ts`) and
Rakazo (`packages/core/src/action-approval.ts`). This design borrows their
patterns, not their code. Nothing may be copied from OpenMausBot's `enterprise/`
folder (separate license).

## Goals

- One Composio account (the user's own API key) powers every app connection.
- The key never leaves the dashboard server process: not in a bot's prompt,
  transcript, tool config, chat, log, or any tracked file.
- The whole Composio catalog is available (like OpenMausBot), minus a short
  blocklist (section 3). A pinned GTM set (section 6) sits at the top of the
  list; everything else is searchable below it.
- Each bot gets apps per workspace (a "grant"), each app either **read** or
  **read + write**. Default: HQ `cos` gets Gmail and Google Calendar
  (read + write); every other bot gets nothing until switched on.
- Reads (search, list, get, fetch) run immediately. Every other app action is
  held in the approvals inbox and runs only on an explicit Approve click,
  enforced by server code, not by asking the model nicely.
- Dashboard: paste the key once (write-only), connect apps through the normal
  OAuth screen, see what's connected, toggle grants per bot.
- Built so teammates can be added later: every connection belongs to a
  *person*, not to the install.

## Non-goals (this round)

- Scheduler / recurring runs ("every morning at 8"). Round 2.
- Event triggers (new-email webhooks). Needs a public endpoint; later.
- Human teammates, logins, invites. Separate project; only the data shape is
  prepared here.
- A hosted relay that lets people use apps without their own key.
- Tailored approval cards beyond Gmail, Google Calendar and Drive. Every
  other app gets the generic card (section 4); tailored cards are added per
  app later.
- Wiring social publishing into the myOS content pipeline (posting an
  approved calendar post to its channel). Round 1 only makes the apps
  reachable; the link is a later round.
- Multiple accounts per app (work + personal Gmail).

## Anti-goals (failure even if it "works")

- A bot can send, reply, delete, post, share, or pay without the user clicking
  Approve on a card that shows the real action.
- The Composio key, or a teammate's connection, reachable by any bot or visible
  in the UI after saving.
- Anyone outside the user's team able to use the user's key.
- Every chat turn paying the token cost of app tool schemas even when no app is
  needed (myOS is token-lean by policy).
- Real account data (emails, addresses, workspace names) in tracked files,
  tests, or fixtures. Public repo; `tests/test_no_usage_data.py` must pass.

## Constraints

- Python stdlib only (`urllib`, `json`, `secrets`, `hmac`), consistent with
  `dashboard/` and `core/`. No new dependencies.
- Dashboard server is `ThreadingHTTPServer` on `127.0.0.1`
  (`dashboard/server.py:1991`), so a running `claude -p` turn can call back into
  it.
- Bots run as `claude -p` subprocesses built in `ChatSession._base_cmd`
  (`dashboard/chat_session.py`). Today they pass `--strict-mcp-config` with no
  config: zero MCP tools. That flag stays; we add an explicit `--mcp-config`.
- Content writes still go only through osctl. App actions are not content
  writes and do not go through osctl.
- Secrets live under gitignored `team/` (`.gitignore:92`).

## Decided by the user

- Composio as the broker (not Pipedream, not self-hosted MCP servers).
- The user's own Composio key; never shared with people outside the team.
  Teammates (later) use the user's Composio project as separate Composio users
  and never see the key.
- Approval before anything goes out.
- **Full catalog, not a curated few** (like OpenMausBot), with every social
  network and Supabase pinned; the rest of the pinned set was picked from
  Composio's catalog for GTM work (section 6).
- Composio first; invites/teammates next, as their own project.
- **Calendar split:** the myOS calendar (`create-activity` / `get-busy` via
  osctl) stays the main calendar for work items. Google Calendar is used only
  when the user says "Google" explicitly or the event invites other people
  (they need a real invite). Calendar words alone do not trigger app tools;
  the RAIL states this rule. Linking the two (e.g. mirroring myOS activities
  into Google Calendar) is a future round.
- **Google OAuth:** use Composio's managed ("ready-made") Google auth. No
  user-owned Google Cloud client this round. `connect_link` uses Composio's
  default auth config, so setup is key + one click per app. Supporting a
  user-owned auth config later must stay possible (keep the auth-config id
  optional in the client).

## Design

### 1. Secret and state store: `team/integrations.json`

Gitignored, written atomically with mode `0600` (reuse `bots._atomic_write`:
`tempfile.mkstemp` already creates the temp file `0600` and `os.replace` keeps
that mode, so there is no world-readable window and no `chmod` step). Writes
go through one module lock (the relay thread may create a session while the UI
saves a grant). Shape:

```json
{
  "composio": {"api_key": "ak_...", "saved": 1761700000},
  "people": {
    "ceo": {"composio_user_id": "myos-3f9c...", "session_id": "...", "mcp_url": "<composio session mcp url>"}
  },
  "grants": {
    "hq": {"cos": {"gmail": "write", "googlecalendar": "write"}},
    "acme": {"social": {"googledrive": "read", "instagram": "write"}}
  }
}
```

- `people` is keyed by myOS person id. Today only `ceo` exists
  (`core/bots.CEO`). Teammates later add rows; nothing else changes.
- `composio_user_id` is a random id generated on first use. Never the user's
  email or name (nothing personal is sent to Composio as an id).
- Grants are per workspace (`hq` or a project slug) and per bot id: a map of
  Composio toolkit slug → `"read"` or `"write"` (OpenMausBot's
  `connectorScopes` idea). `read`: anything that is not a read is refused
  outright, not even held. `write`: reads run, everything else is held for
  approval (section 4); `write` never means "runs without asking". A
  *missing* grant for HQ `cos` falls back to the default above; an explicit
  `{}` means none (the user switched it off). Everything else defaults to
  none. A blocklisted toolkit can never be granted.
- Add `integrations.json` to `SECRET_FILE_GLOBS` in `chat_session.py`, which
  turns into `Read(**/integrations.json)` on every turn, HQ included. No
  blanket `team/**` deny for HQ: HQ "sees everything" by design
  (`_workspace_deny_dirs` returns `()` for HQ) and company bots already have
  `team/` in their deny dirs. Test: an HQ turn's `--disallowedTools` contains
  the integrations rule.
- API responses never return `api_key`; only `{"configured": true, "saved": ts}`.

### 2. Composio client: `core/composio.py`

Thin stdlib wrapper around Composio's REST API (base
host `backend.composio.dev`, path `/api/v3.1`, header `x-api-key`), as OpenMausBot
uses it:

- `ensure_session(person)` → create or reuse a session
  (`POST /tool_router/session`), store `session_id` + `mcp_url`. Reject an
  `mcp_url` whose host is not Composio's. The session is locked down at
  Composio too, not only by our relay (defense in depth):
  `{"user_id": ..., "toolkits": {"disable": [<BLOCKED_TOOLKITS>]},
  "manage_connections": {"enable": false}, "workbench": {"enable": false}}`
  (plus `auth_configs` only when a user-owned one is set). Disabling the
  workbench removes `COMPOSIO_REMOTE_WORKBENCH` / `COMPOSIO_REMOTE_BASH_TOOL`
  server-side. If the session is gone (401/404) or the blocklist changes,
  create a new one (or `PATCH /tool_router/session/{id}`) and store it.
  Connections belong to the Composio user, not the session, so recreating it
  keeps every connection.
- `catalog()` → the Composio toolkit list (`GET /toolkits`, paginated, sorted
  by usage, as OpenMausBot reads it), cached in memory for an hour, blocklist
  removed. Each entry keeps `slug`, `name`, logo, and its auth kind (managed
  OAuth / own OAuth app needed / API key). If Composio cannot be reached, the
  panel falls back to the pinned list.
- `connect_link(person, toolkit)` → start a connection, return the redirect
  URL for the browser (docs list `POST /tool_router/session/{id}/link`;
  verify body). Composio's hosted connect page also collects API keys for
  key-based apps (PostHog, Beehiiv); the builder verifies this, else the
  panel asks for the key and sends it straight to Composio, never storing it.
- `connections(person)` → which toolkits are connected
  (`GET /tool_router/session/{id}/toolkits`).
- `execute(person, slug, arguments)` → run one approved tool call. **Never
  retried** (timeout, 5xx, connection error): a retry can send an email
  twice. Composio's own SDK dropped execute retries in Oct 2026 for the same
  reason.
- HTTP: one `urllib` opener with redirects **disabled** (stdlib redirect
  handling copies custom headers, so a redirect would carry `x-api-key` to
  another host) and a fixed timeout. Error text logged or returned never
  includes request headers.

The builder must verify exact endpoint paths and payloads against Composio's
current docs (they changed in 2026) and pin what works in tests with recorded
fake responses. No live network calls in the test suite.

### 3. The relay: one internal MCP endpoint on the dashboard server

Bots never talk to Composio. Each app-enabled turn gets an HTTP MCP server
entry pointing back at the dashboard:

```
--mcp-config '{"mcpServers":{"apps":{"type":"http",
  "url":"http://127.0.0.1:<port>/api/internal/apps/mcp",
  "headers":{"Authorization":"Bearer ${MYOS_APPS_TOKEN}"}}}}'
--allowedTools mcp__apps
```

The token itself is **not** in argv: `ps` shows every process's arguments to
every local user, while another user cannot read this process's environment.
It goes in the child env as `MYOS_APPS_TOKEN` (added next to
`MYOS_WORKSPACE` in `ChatSession.ask`). The builder verifies Claude Code
expands `${VAR}` inside an inline `--mcp-config`; if it does not, write the
config to a `0600` file under `team/` (`mkstemp`) and delete it in the turn's
`finally`.

- **Turn token**: `secrets.token_hex(32)`, kept in server memory, bound to
  `{ws, bot, chat, person}`. Its life is the **chat request**, not one
  process: a turn can run the lead, then a lead follow-up (a second
  `claude -p --resume` after teammate consults). Mint it before the lead run,
  pass it to both lead runs, revoke it in the `_handle_ask` `finally` (plus a
  hard max age, e.g. 30 min). It only unlocks this relay with this bot's
  filters, so a bot reading it from its own process gains nothing. Compared
  with `hmac.compare_digest`.
- **Routing**: `do_POST` rejects every request without the dashboard cookie
  before looking at the path (`dashboard/server.py:1613`), and the bot's MCP
  client has no cookie. The relay path is matched **before** that check, still
  requires `_valid_host()`, accepts only the turn token, and is the only path
  exempted. A request with a cookie but no valid token is refused.
- The gate (grant, read rule, hold) is written against a small upstream
  interface (`list_tools`, `call`), with Composio as its only
  implementation this round, so own MCP servers can be added later
  without touching the gate (see "Prepared for later rounds").
- The relay forwards MCP JSON-RPC to the person's session `mcp_url`, adding
  `x-api-key`. It must handle Composio's streamable-HTTP responses (plain JSON
  or `text/event-stream`) and the `mcp-session-id` header. It forwards
  `initialize`, `notifications/*`, `tools/list` (filtered) and `tools/call`
  (gated); any other method is refused.
- **tools/list filter**: only expose `COMPOSIO_SEARCH_TOOLS`,
  `COMPOSIO_GET_TOOL_SCHEMAS`, `COMPOSIO_MULTI_EXECUTE_TOOL`. Hide everything
  else, in particular `COMPOSIO_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS`,
  `COMPOSIO_WAIT_FOR_CONNECTIONS`, `COMPOSIO_REMOTE_WORKBENCH`,
  `COMPOSIO_REMOTE_BASH_TOOL`, `COMPOSIO_PROXY_EXECUTE` (connecting accounts
  happens only in the dashboard; raw code/HTTP can do anything and cannot be
  classified).
- **tools/call gate**: unpack the call into individual app tool slugs (a
  multi-execute carries a list of `{tool_slug, arguments}`, see OpenMausBot
  `shared/outbound.ts` `connectorCallsIn`). For each slug:
  - toolkit (slug prefix, e.g. `GMAIL_`) not in this bot's grant, or
    blocklisted → refuse.
  - a read on a toolkit whose reads spend money (`PAID_READ_TOOLKITS`, e.g.
    `apollo` enrichment) → treated as a write.
  - a read → forward now.
  - anything else on a `read` grant → refuse.
  - anything else on a `write` grant → do not forward; queue it (section 4).
  - hidden/unknown meta tool → refuse.
  A call that mixes reads and writes: reads run, writes queue; the reply text
  says which.
  The relay never forwards the bot's original body. It **rebuilds** the
  multi-execute call from the read entries only, with only the known fields
  (`tools: [{tool_slug, arguments}]` plus whatever Composio requires), so
  extras such as `sync_response_to_workbench` never reach Composio.
- **Read rule** (deliberately narrow, Rakazo-style): split the action part of
  the slug (after the toolkit prefix) on `_`. It is a read only if its
  **first word** is one of `GET LIST FETCH SEARCH READ FIND RETRIEVE LOOKUP
  VIEW CHECK COUNT` (whole-word match, so `FINDANDREPLACE` is not a read)
  **and** no word anywhere is a write verb (`SEND REPLY FORWARD CREATE ADD
  INSERT UPDATE PATCH MODIFY EDIT REPLACE MOVE COPY DELETE REMOVE TRASH
  SHARE INVITE ACCEPT DECLINE SET APPLY MARK ARCHIVE UPLOAD`), or the slug is
  in a small known-reads set for noun-first names
  (`GOOGLECALENDAR_EVENTS_LIST`, `GOOGLECALENDAR_EVENTS_GET`,
  `GOOGLECALENDAR_LIST_CALENDARS`, ...; and Google Maps' lookups, which
  are noun- or verb-first without a read verb: autocomplete, geocode,
  reverse geocode, nearby search, text search, place details/photo,
  route, route matrix, time zone, map tiles, embed, aerial video; its
  `CREATE_TILES_SESSION` stays a write). Everything else is a write,
  including creating Gmail drafts, labels, updates and deletes. Unlike
  OpenMausBot, drafts are not exempt, and neither is anything else that is
  not a send (OpenMausBot runs updates, deletes and even calendar events with
  attendees without a card). Supabase `EXECUTE_...QUERY` is always held,
  card showing the full SQL. The toolkit of a slug is the **longest** catalog
  toolkit slug whose `UPPER(slug) + "_"` it starts with (slugs can contain
  underscores, e.g. `google_search_console`, as OpenMausBot handles it); no
  match → refuse.
- **Blocklist** (`BLOCKED_TOOLKITS`): toolkits whose "reads" reach arbitrary
  hosts or run code, so an injected email could make a bot "read"
  `attacker.example/?d=<mail>` with no card: web search/scrape/fetch
  (`composio_search`, `firecrawl`, `tavily`, `exa`, `serpapi`,
  `perplexityai`, browser toolkits), code runners (`codeinterpreter`), the
  meta `composio` toolkit, and `googlesuper` (bundles every Google app and
  would bypass per-app grants). Hidden from the panel, disabled in the
  session, refused by the relay. The builder sweeps the catalog's
  search/scraping/browser/code categories when writing the list. OpenMausBot
  has no such list; with the full catalog open we need one.

### 4. Held actions in the approvals inbox

Extend `core/approvals.py` with a second kind:

```json
{"id": "...", "kind": "app_action", "ws": "hq", "room": "...", "chat": "...",
 "bot": "cos", "person": "ceo", "status": "pending", "created": 0,
 "action": {"toolkit": "gmail", "slug": "GMAIL_SEND_EMAIL", "arguments": {...}},
 "preview": {"title": "Send email", "fields": [["To","..."],["Subject","..."],["Body","..."]]}}
```

- The **preview is built by the server from the real arguments**, never from
  the bot's words. An email can carry injected instructions; the card must
  show exactly what will happen (recipients, subject, full body, attachments,
  event times, etc.). Tailored cards this round: Gmail, Google Calendar,
  Drive. Every other app gets the generic card: the tool's name in words
  (`INSTAGRAM_CREATE_CAROUSEL_CONTAINER` → "Instagram: create carousel
  container") plus every argument as a labeled field, long text in full,
  nested values as formatted JSON. Nothing is truncated or summarized.
- The relay returns to the bot: `Held for approval (<id>): <title>. It has not
  run. Tell the user it is waiting in Approvals.` The turn continues; nothing
  blocks.
- **Approve** (explicit click only) → under the approvals lock, flip
  `pending` → `running` (any other status: refuse, so a double click or a
  second tab cannot send twice), then call `composio.execute` once with the
  stored action, set `done` or `failed`, record the result, and post a short
  result line into the same thread (`Sent.` / the error). A timeout or
  connection error is `failed` with "may or may not have gone out, check the
  app" and is never retried automatically. **No** → status `rejected`,
  nothing runs. **Edit** → the user edits the arguments in the card (for an
  email: to, subject, body); the server rebuilds the preview from the edited
  arguments, then the user approves.
- Rows with no `kind` are the existing chat approvals (`kind: "chat"`); old
  files keep working unchanged.
- `app_action` rows are **not** touched by the existing rules for chat
  approvals: `resolve_chat` skips them (it runs on every new user message in
  the thread *and* behind `/api/approvals/dismiss`), and `add` supersedes only
  pending chat rows, never an `app_action` (several replies can be pending at
  once). Pending app actions expire after 7 days (`expired`), checked lazily
  on load.
- Housekeeping: `approvals.STATUSES` gains `running`, `done`, `failed`,
  `expired`; the `KEEP` trim must never drop a pending or running
  `app_action`; guard every `approvals.json` read-modify-write with one lock
  (the relay thread now writes it too); re-check the grant and connection at
  Approve time, not only at hold time.
- Approve/No/Edit endpoints use the normal dashboard auth
  (`_authorized(require_origin=True)`), never the turn token. A bot cannot
  approve its own action.

### 5. When a turn gets app tools

Token-lean, same spirit as `_needs_web` (`dashboard/server.py:490`):

- Key configured, the person has a session, and the turn's **lead bot** has a
  non-empty grant in this workspace, **and** either the message tags `@apps`
  (or `/apps`) or matches an app-intent pattern for one of the granted
  toolkits: for Gmail, mailbox phrases only (inbox, gmail, unread, "my
  email(s)/mail", "reply to <someone/this email/thread>"), not bare
  "email"/"reply", which also mean content work such as newsletter copy; for
  Google Calendar, "google calendar", or a meeting/event with other people
  (plain calendar words stay on the myOS calendar, see the calendar split
  above); for Drive, drive/google doc. Every other app triggers only on
  `@apps` or a possessive "my <app>" phrase ("my instagram stats", "check my
  supabase"). A bare app name never does: "write a LinkedIn post" is content
  work for the myOS pipeline, not an app call.
- An explicit `/skill` tag wins over app intent (it is a content turn).
- Otherwise no `--mcp-config` (today's behavior).
- App turns use `ESCALATED_MODEL`, like web turns. `_pick_model` would
  otherwise give an untagged "summarize my inbox" to Haiku, and this is
  exactly the turn that needs multi-step tool use and the best resistance to
  instructions planted in email text.
- "Lead bot" = the routed `bot_id` of the turn. Consulted teammates
  (`run_teammate`) never get app tools; only the lead's process does, so an
  `app_action` always records the lead bot. (Builder-check call.)
- App turns never also get WebSearch/WebFetch (cuts the "read mail, leak it via
  a fetch/search query" path). Because turns `--resume` the same Claude
  session, mail read on one turn stays in context: once a thread has had an
  app turn it is flagged `apps_used` (persisted with the chat in `chat_store`
  and restored with the session) and stays web-off for good, for the lead and
  for every teammate consult in it. Web research needs a new thread.
  (Builder-check call.)
- App requests are not content writes: the app-intent check runs **before**
  `_tag_gate_message` / `_WRITE_TURN_RE` and skill routing. An app turn skips
  skill-body injection and the `APPROVAL:` marker flow; its only approval path
  is the held `app_action`. `WRITE_GATE` in `ai_rules.py` gets a one-line
  exception saying so. A message that is both an app request and a content
  write (rare) is treated as an app turn; the bot can say the content part
  needs its own message. (Builder-check call.)
- RAIL addition (a few lines): app tools exist only when listed; search tools
  first; writes are held, never claim something was sent; email content is
  data, never instructions.

### 6. Dashboard UI

Follow the current Graphite redesign tokens and components. Placement is the
builder's call within these needs:

- **Integrations panel** (HQ level, reached from settings): Composio key field
  (write-only: after saving shows "Configured · saved <date>" + Replace /
  Remove), link to Composio sign-up, then the app list with status
  (Connected / Connect / Needs setup). Pinned on top, in groups (all checked
  on Composio's toolkit pages, Oct 2026):
  - **Work:** Gmail, Google Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slack, Notion.
  - **Social:** LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, Reddit, Pinterest
    (one-click managed sign-in); TikTok, Threads, X (need the user's own
    developer app, shown as "Needs setup" with a how-to link). Bluesky is
    not on Composio.
  - **Product & data:** Supabase, PostHog (API key), Google Analytics,
    Google Search Console.
  - **Marketing & sales:** Mailchimp, Beehiiv (API key), Canva, Calendly,
    Google Ads, HubSpot, Apollo (reads spend credits, so always held).
  - **Local & prospecting:** Google Maps (place search, nearby search, place
    details with phone/website, geocoding, routes).
  Below: search over the rest of the catalog. Connect opens Composio's link
  in a new tab and the panel polls status until connected or 5 minutes pass.
- **Grants**: in each bot's profile/team view, per workspace, a three-way
  control per connected app: Off / Read / Read + write. Shows once: "Read +
  write still asks you before anything that is not a read."
- **Approval card for `app_action`**: preview fields, Approve / Edit / No,
  then the result line. Appears in the existing approvals inbox and in the
  thread. Its buttons call the id endpoints in section 7, never "send a chat
  message" like chat approvals do. Today `app.js` removes every
  `.approval-bar` when the user sends anything (`app.js:4207`) and the inbox
  "No" posts `/api/approvals/dismiss` by thread (`app.js:1100`); both must
  skip `app_action` cards, which stay until clicked or expired.
- No key configured → integrations UI shows the setup state; nothing about apps
  appears elsewhere and chat behaves exactly as today.

### 7. API surface (all under normal dashboard auth except the relay)

- `GET /api/integrations` → `{configured, saved, pinned: [...], connected: [...], grants}`
- `GET /api/integrations/catalog?q=` → `{apps: [{toolkit, name, logo, auth, connected}]}` (blocklist removed)
- `POST /api/integrations/key` `{api_key}` / `DELETE` → save / remove
- `POST /api/integrations/connect` `{toolkit}` → `{url}` (blocklisted → 400)
- `POST /api/integrations/grants` `{ws, bot, apps: {<toolkit>: "read"|"write"}}` (blocklisted → 400)
- `POST /api/approvals/<id>/approve` `{arguments?}` · `/reject`
- `POST /api/internal/apps/mcp` → relay (turn token only)

## Testing

- Unit tests (`tests/`, unittest, existing style) with a fake Composio server
  or patched `urllib` responses: session reuse, untrusted `mcp_url` rejection,
  tools/list filtering, read/write classification table (including
  `FINDANDREPLACE`-style and write-verb-inside names), toolkit-grant refusal,
  `read` grant refuses a write outright, blocklisted toolkit refused at
  connect, grant and relay, paid-read toolkit held, longest-prefix toolkit
  match (`GOOGLE_SEARCH_CONSOLE_*`), generic card shows every argument,
  mixed multi-execute (forwarded body holds only read entries and known
  fields), held action creation, approve → execute exactly once (double
  approve refused while `running`), execute timeout → `failed` with no retry,
  reject → no call, new chat message and `/api/approvals/dismiss` do not
  resolve an `app_action`, a chat `APPROVAL:` does not supersede it, rows
  without `kind` still work, token revocation after the follow-up run,
  relay refuses cookie-only and bad tokens and is reachable without a cookie,
  token absent from argv, redirects not followed, session created with the
  locked-down config, key never present in any API response, `_base_cmd` adds
  `--mcp-config` only under the section 5 rule, drops web tools on app turns,
  and app turns pick `ESCALATED_MODEL`.
- Fixtures use generic slugs only (`demo`, `acme`, `profile-a`) and fake
  addresses on `example.com` (the guard's `GENERIC_EMAIL_DOMAINS` allows only
  `example.com/.net/.org/.invalid`; `example.test` would fail it). Run
  `tests/test_no_usage_data.py`.
- One manual live check by the user with their own key: connect Gmail, ask
  `@cos` to summarize the inbox, ask for a reply, approve it, confirm it sent.

## Prepared for later rounds

- **Scheduler**: a held action already doesn't need the user online; a
  scheduled run will reuse the same relay + turn token with `chat` set to the
  routine's thread.
- **Teammates**: `people` rows + per-person sessions already exist; invites and
  logins decide who `person` is for a turn. Today every turn is `ceo`.
- **Social publishing**: an approved post in the content calendar becomes one
  held `app_action` for its channel's app (Instagram carousel, LinkedIn post,
  ...), with a tailored card per platform.
- **Own MCP servers (open-source tools)**: a second upstream kind beside
  Composio, as OpenMausBot does with its `own_apps` server. The user adds a
  server in the Integrations panel: a local command (stdio) or an HTTP URL,
  e.g. a self-hosted Postiz, Listmonk, Plausible/Umami, Twenty, Cal.com, n8n,
  Chatwoot, NocoDB or Baserow (MCP support checked per tool then). Same
  rules as Composio apps: per-bot Off / Read / Read + write grants, reads run,
  everything else held with a card, thread goes web-off. No Composio key
  needed. Differences: a local server is code on the user's machine, so it
  runs only after the user adds it explicitly; tool names are not
  `APP_ACTION`-shaped, so the read rule uses the name check plus the
  server's `readOnlyHint` only as a hint, defaulting to held; the server's
  secrets live in `team/integrations.json` like the Composio key. Round 1
  keeps the relay upstream-agnostic (section 3) so this is an addition, not
  a rewrite.
- **First own tool: Agent Reach** (open-source, MIT, Python CLI, repo
  `Panniantong/Agent-Reach`): read-only research across web pages, RSS,
  YouTube, GitHub, X, Reddit, LinkedIn, Instagram and more. Use: competitor
  and audience research for ventures. Not an MCP server, it is shell
  commands, so it goes behind a small wrapper exposing a fixed list of read
  commands (no free shell, no arbitrary flags). Step 1: no-login channels
  only (web, RSS, YouTube, GitHub). Step 2, opt-in: cookie channels
  (X, Reddit, LinkedIn), on a secondary account the user chooses.
  **Security, check before building:**
  - Everything it returns is untrusted web text: treat as data, never
    instructions (prompt injection rides in on posts and pages).
  - Never in the same turn as connected apps: an app turn is web-off so
    private data (inbox, Drive) cannot leak out through a fetched URL or a
    search query; Agent Reach counts as web.
  - Browser cookies are account keys: store them like the Composio key
    (`team/integrations.json`, 0600, unreadable by bots), never the user's
    main accounts, never copied into `~/.agent-reach/config.yaml` readable
    by bot turns; add that path to `SECRET_FILE_GLOBS`.
  - Pin the package version and review its source before install; it runs
    as the user on this machine. Re-review on every upgrade.
  - The wrapper validates arguments (URL scheme http/https only, no local
    or private hosts, bounded length) so a bot cannot use it to reach
    `127.0.0.1` or LAN services.
  - Rate-limit per turn; scraping too fast gets the account banned.

## Left to the builder

- Exact Composio endpoint shapes (verify against current docs), including the
  session lockdown fields and the `/link` body.
- Whether Claude Code expands `${MYOS_APPS_TOKEN}` in an inline
  `--mcp-config` (else the `0600` temp-file fallback in section 3).
- UI placement and copy within section 6.
- Exact app-intent regex and the known-reads list beyond the examples.
- The full `BLOCKED_TOOLKITS` and `PAID_READ_TOOLKITS` lists, from a sweep of
  the catalog.
- Exact Google Maps tool slugs for the known-reads set (from the catalog).
  Maps lookups are billed by Google per request; on an API-key connection
  the cost lands on the user's Google Cloud bill. The Integrations panel
  says so next to Maps.
- Module split inside `dashboard/` (e.g. `dashboard/apps_relay.py`) and how the
  turn token registry is threaded through `ChatSession`.

## Repo guard note

`tests/test_no_usage_data.py` rejects any `http(s)://host` in tracked files that
is not in `PUBLIC_NETWORK_HOSTS`. The implementation must add
`backend.composio.dev` there (a public vendor API host, not user data), and
must not hardcode any other Composio host: session MCP URLs come from the API
at runtime and are validated against Composio's domain.
